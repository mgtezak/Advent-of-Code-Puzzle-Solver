# Advent-of-Code-Puzzle-Solver

*[link to the project](https://aoc-puzzle-solver.streamlit.app/)*

Hello, I'm [Michael Tezak](https://mgtezak.github.io) and I like solving puzzles on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) with python.
If you're not familiar with this christmas-themed coding calendar and you're into sharpening your problem-solving skills 
using your favorite programming language, I highly recommend you check it out!

Every year over the course of 25 days starting on December 1st, the creator [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) uploads daily coding challenges.
Each challenge has two parts, the first one is oftentimes a lot easier and serves as a warm-up for the second one. 
A cool thing about these challenges is that everyone gets their own individual puzzle input, such that everyone's puzzle answer 
will be different as well. 

If you get stuck there's a huge community on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), 
youtube and various other platforms, of people sharing their approaches to each problem.
I learned a ton about programming in python by trying to solve these problems and then going online and comparing my solution to those of others.
With this website I'd like to contribute to this community, by sharing my own code and creating a fun interface to play around with.

That being said, I put this project together in a very short time and it is still a work in progress that I plan to build upon 
in the future. For instance, I've only solved about half of the puzzles so far, and I haven't even uploaded all of my solutions yet.
I hope you enjoy this prototype nonetheless! If you're interested in how I built this app, check out this repo.
