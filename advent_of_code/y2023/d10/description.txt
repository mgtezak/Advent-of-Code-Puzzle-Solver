### Part 1 

***Problem:***
- We're in a two-dimensional grid where each tile is made up either of empty space (`.`) or a different shaped pipe (`|` and `-` are straight pipes, whereas `L`, `J`, `7` and `F` are 90Â° curved pipes)
- We start out at `S` which is layered on top of a pipe tile, although it's not yet clear which type of pipe
- There is a closed loop of connected pipes starting at `S`
- How many steps along the loop does it take to get to the point farthest from the starting position?
