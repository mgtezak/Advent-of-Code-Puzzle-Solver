### Part 1 

***Problem:***
- We get a grid of numbers, dots and other symbols
- We're interested in numbers that are adjacent (even diagonally) to one or more symbols
- What is the sum of these numbers?


***Approach:***
- Create a `set` of all (row, col) coordinates around each symbol
- Find the index-span and value of each number and check if any of its indices is inside the `set`
- Return the sum of the `int` value of such numbers

### Part 2 

***Problem:***
- Now we're interested in `*` symbols, which have exactly two numbers adjacent to it
- Such a symbol represents a gear and its gear ratio is the product of the two numbers around it 
- What is the sum of all gear ratios?


***Approach:***
- Create a `dict` where the keys are the coordinate-pair of every `*` symbol and the values are empty lists
- Find the coordinate-span and the value of each number and iterate the coordinates adjacent to it
- If any of these coordinate-pairs are in the `dict`, append the number value its entry
- Finally, iterate the `dict` values to find those lists with a `len` of 2 and take their product
- Return the sum of these products
