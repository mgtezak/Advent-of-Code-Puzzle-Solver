### Part 1 

***Problem:***
- We get sequences of numbers and for each sequence we need to predict the next number through repeated differencing
- What is the sum of the predicted next number of each sequence

***Approach:***
- Differencing a sequence of length $n$ means creating a new sequence of length $n-1$ where each element expresses the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the original sequence
- For each sequence create a `while` loop to difference it as many times as necessary until it consists only of $0$s
- At each iteration of the loop store the last number of the sequence
- The final number of the original sequence will be the sum of these
- Return the sum of all of these final numbers
