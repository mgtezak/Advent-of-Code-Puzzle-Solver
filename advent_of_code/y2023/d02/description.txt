#### Part 1 task:

- Each line represents a single game, where an elf picks out a handful of differently colored cubes multiple times
- He shows them to you and puts them back in the bag before taking out the next handful
- Now, if there were only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes in bag, some of these games would not be possible
- What is the sum of the IDs of possible games (first game's ID = 1, second game's ID = 2 etc.)?


#### My suggested approach:

- Create a `dict` which maps the three colors to their max values (12, 13 & 14) and a variable `total = 0` which keeps track of our return value
- Iterate the lines and keep track of their indices
- For each line find all numbers followed by a color
- For each number-color pair check if the number exceeds the max value of that color
- If it does move on to the next line, if it never does add the ID to the total (I used a `for/else` loop with a `break` statement for this â€“ [*learn more*](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/for_-_else.html))
- Return `total`

#### Part 2 task:

- Now we're interested in the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make each game possible
- For each game calculate the product of the minimum numbers of each color
- What is the sum of these products?

#### My suggested approach:

- Again, initiate the return variable `total = 0` and iterate the lines
- For each line initialize a `dict` which keeps track of the max value of each color (starting at `0`)
- Iterate line and update the max values of each color
- Add the product of these max values to `total`
- Return `total`
