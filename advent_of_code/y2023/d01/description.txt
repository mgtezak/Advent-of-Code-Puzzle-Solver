#### Part 1 task:
- Pick out the first and last digit of every line (can potentially be the same one)
- Concatenate them to form a two-digit number
- Return the sum of these two-digit numbers



#### My approach:
- Initiate the return variable `total`
- Iterate through lines and extract all digits. Possible with `str.isdigit` but I used `re.findall` with `\d`
- Take the first and last digit, concatenate them. This can be done using `+`, since they are still strings, it won't add them up mathematically
- Turn the concatenated number string into an integer (`int`) and add it to `total`
- Return `total`

#### Part 2 task:
- The same as part 1, but now words such as *one*, *two* etc. also count



#### My approach:
- Create a data structure to map words to their corresponding numbers (usually done with a `dict` but I simply used a `list`)
- Create a new regular expression pattern that captures not only digits `\d` but also words (when trying to match different things use the OR operator `|` for the regex)
- Careful, some words overlap: in *oneight* 1 and 8 share the letter *e*. In order to capture both numbers we need a "lookahead" assertion `?=` to avoid the algorithm matching the 1 but missing the 8
- Otherwise the same basic structure as in part 1
