        Hello, I'm [Michael Tezak](https://mgtezak.github.io) and I like solving puzzles on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
        If you're not familiar with this christmas-themed coding calendar and you're into sharpening your problem-solving skills 
        using your favorite programming language, I highly recommend you check it out!

        Every year over the course of 25 days starting on December 1st, the creator [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) uploads daily coding challenges.
        Each challenges has two parts, the first one oftentimes being a lot easier, thereby serving as a warm-up for the second one. 
        A cool thing about these challenges is that everyone gets their own individual puzzle input, such that everyone's puzzle answer 
        will be different as well. 

        If you get stuck there's a huge community on reddit, youtube and various other platforms, who share their approaches to each problem.
        I learned a ton about programming in python by trying to solve these problems and then going online and and comparing my solution to others.
        With this website I'd like to contribute to this community, by sharing my own code.

        That being said, I put this project together in a very short time and it is still a work in progress and I plan to build upon 
        it in the future. For instance, I haven't actually solved every puzzle yet and I want to keep adding new solutions. Then instead of simply 
        sharing my solutions, I'd like to actually explain the logic behind them. Eventually I'd also love to add solutions in languages other 
        than python.
