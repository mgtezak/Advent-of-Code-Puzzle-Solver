        - Puzzle completions decrease per day as puzzles get harder
        - Puzzle completions increase per year, although 2015 and 2023 currently break this trend
        - The relatively low completions of 2023 can be explained by the recency of the event
        - The relatively high completions of 2015 can probably be explained in two ways:
            1. people are curious to see how it all started
            2. people are planning to do all of the years in chronological order, but haven't gotten very far yet 
        - There is a significant jump from 2019 to 2020 where completions double ‚Äì I wonder if this can partially be explained by the Covid lockdowns (although they happened in 2020 before the event, so maybe not)

        - The highest annual score ever achieved was by an anonymous user
        - Why be anonymous? Perhaps they don't seek fame at all and are just in it for the love of the game. Perhaps they don't want their bosses finding out, what they spend much of their productive energy on :-P
